the_user_has_three_trials_to_guess.
everytime_he_guess_i_give_feedback_if_it_is_lower_or_higher.

## Workflow
first i imported the random module and the regular expression module , then ask about the level of playing (easy , average , hard ) and according to level i choose a random number between (0 and 10) or (0 and 50) or (0 and 100)
then a flag to keep knowing if the player won or not and then a while loop with taking the user input and check if its in the range and if its actually a digit
if the user won he will go out of the loop if not he still have his remaining number of trials
